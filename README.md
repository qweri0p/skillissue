# SkillIssue
***I don't own the domain yet so this might change***
***
### What am I doing?
Every year from now on I will be buying a domain for a year, and messing around with html, css, and js/ts and this is my next ~~disapointment~~ masterpiece after this year's [sugoma.xyz](sugoma.xyz) ([source code](https://github.com/qweri0p/sugoma.xyz)).

### What the f*** is skillissue?
I'm not sure either but I have a couple of ideas:
1. An annoying platforming game where if you die it just says "Skill issue"
2. A SIMPLE multiplayer game with the prisoner's dilemma being a big point
3. IDK There a bunch of things I can do. I only started thinking about this yesterday so we'll see.
4. Terrible snake game with multiplayer like tetris ___~~2000~~___ 99
I will probably do all suggestions eventually, as like a side project.

Currently rewriting absolutely everything in a javascript framework.

### Building

### Contributing
