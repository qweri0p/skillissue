***I don't own the domain yet so this might change***

###What am I doing?
Every year from now on I will be buying a domain for a year, and messing around with html, css, and js/ts and this is my next ~~disapointment~~ masterpiece after this year's [sugoma.xyz](sugoma.xyz) ([source code](https://github.com/qweri0p/sugoma.xyz)).

###What the f*** is skillissue?
I'm not sure either but I have a couple of ideas:
1. An annoying platforming game where if you die it just says "Skill issue"
2. A SIMPLE multiplayer game with the prisoner's dilemma being a big point
3. IDK There a bunch of things I can do. I only started thinking about this yesterday so we'll see.

I will probably do both suggestions eventually, as like a side project.

###Building
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Clone the repo
3. In the repo directory run:``yarn``
4. Then ``yarn build``
